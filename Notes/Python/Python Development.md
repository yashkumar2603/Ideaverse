1. mern complete 
2. python -> learn about python development -> oops, do projects (intermediate to advanced projects) -> learn about backend in python and normal developer practices (search in yt about dev in py) + DBMS (django, no need to know everything, just be familiar cause this may not be needed) 
3. learn c++ but for development -> oops + projects (intermediate to advanced) 
4. learn cmake, learn how projects are built, learn how games are built using cmake (games devs use a lot of cmake so you'll understand what is it)
