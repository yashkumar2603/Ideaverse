Now, with the current structure, say we want to add in a new weapon.
We just need to create a different triad from this master name layer.
Then inside of the name layer we created, we just need to assign the enemies that the weapon needs
and link the layer when the weapon is equipped.
And this works for any amount of weapons we have.
Building up our animation system this way saves us the pain from modifying our main animation blueprint
every time we add in a new weapon, and it just saves us a lot of work for building the anim graph for our project.
