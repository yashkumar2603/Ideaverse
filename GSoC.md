September is a good time to start, best. Don't give the vibe, that u are only for gsoc. also don't ask too many questions, if a bug is in setting up project, then fix ur machine, not ping the maintainer.
**October** - sort orgs, introduce and then start solving by 10th, **Participate in Hacktober Fest** by mid **November** solve 3 small to medium bugs in 3 projects each. Now, the maintainers are comfortable with me. 
Then go for harder or sensitive mediums. and don't take more than u can chew, if u are not able to solve more than 50 percent even, then it leaves a bad impression.
Have very good impression with maintainers by december, January and Feb. solve very big issues and harden ur reputation.
By December solved some bugs + maintainers know me, ask questions, not too many. And introduce urself. make sure maintainers in 3 repos know me before crowd hits in Jan-Feb.
Aggressive contributions in January. In January, solve big issues and with minimal help from maintainers, as u are familiar with stack and codebase. Stand out and scare puny new niggers away basically, by solving big issues.
If someone clearly better comes, don't get emotionally attached and just move to the other 2 projects, by Jan u must have 2 projects only, rule out the 3rd one.
Contribute aggressively even after putting in the proposal. Contris matter till results time.
